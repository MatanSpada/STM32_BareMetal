/*
 * In this example we want the push button on the nucleo board to function as an input.
 * That's why we need to search in the "nucleo_user_guide".
 * In the section "Push-buttons" on page 23 we can see that the user-button is connected to pc13: GPIOC pin 13.
 * First we need to enable the clock for this port, so we check in the data sheet (block diagram), which bus has this port.
 * Bus AHB1. now we search in the reference manual to see which bits in AHB1-enable registration is required.
 * we look for ahb1enr - advanced high performance bus 1. enable register (RCC_AHB1ENR).
 * we need to write to bit number 2.
