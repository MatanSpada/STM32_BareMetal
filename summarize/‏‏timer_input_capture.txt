In Capture Mode:
CCR1 stores the timer counter value at the exact moment an external event occurs (e.g., a rising or falling edge on a GPIO pin linked to the timer).

In Compare Mode:
CCR1 is a register where you store a value that the timer counter will compare against.
If the timer counter matches this value, a predefined action occurs, such as toggling a GPIO pin or generating an interrupt.
Reading TIM3->CCR1 in this case gives the value you're using for the comparison.
